In my time at St. Paul's Hospital, I was given the chance to design and develop a new freezer monitoring server. The key idea behind this project was to implement an easy monitoring and quick, reliable alerting system for the freezers containing organs, blood, etc. The temperature setting is critical in this setting and the slightest drop in the temperature can lead to a big aftermath. I main focus was to design something that people could check on a daily basis, quickly, without having to search for anything. This led me to choosing Nagios to act as the main server showing all system's state, InfluxDB to collect temperatures at all times, and Grafana to allow easy visualization of the freezers."
