You can create complex monitoring dashboards using interactive query builders, as well as personalize and extend the Grafana experience through the use of plugins. One of the core plugins included out of the box with Grafana is the Elasticsearch data source plugin, enabling users to visualize metrics and logs stored in an Elasticsearch instance. During my internship at AWS, I was able to take part in finding a solution to provide users with a new Grafana Open Distro for Elasticsearch (ODFE) data source plugin which provides the core Elasticsearch plugin functionalities along with additional Pipe Processing Language (PPL) support as an alternative query syntax option to improve the user experience of querying data in Grafana."

        description:"In a hospital settings, it is critical that there is a reliable monitoring system for all systems. In my time at St. Paul's Hospital, I was given the chance to design and develop a new freezer monitoring server. The key idea behind this project was to implement an easy monitoring and quick, reliable alerting system for the freezers containing organs, blood, etc. The temperature setting is critical in this setting and the slightest drop in the temperature can lead to a big aftermath. I main focus was to design something that people could check on a daily basis, quickly, without having to search for anything. This led me to choosing Nagios to act as the main server showing all system's state, InfluxDB to collect temperatures at all times, and Grafana to allow easy visualization of the freezers."
